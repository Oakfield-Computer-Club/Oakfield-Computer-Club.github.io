        "title": "Welcome to the club!",
        "description": "Our club encourages adoption of best practice software development techniques from your first steps onwards. We want to help you get building things quickly whilst building good habits. Our club is free and staffed entirely by volunteers.",
        "foundation": "The club was formed as a response to poor foundational software development skills being taught in UK schools, colleges and universities. We hope to learn together about what works and what does not in a fast paced environment.",
        "membership": "Currently membership is limited to 8 students as we have 2 professional software developers and we would like a 1:4 ratio. We are hoping to expand in the future so please join our Discord to enquire about membership even if we are full."
